# web.community

this repo holds the website at https://web.community

it's hosted with [github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). whenever the `main` branch gets updated, the contents will be published and the website will be updated.

# making a change

we support both proposal-first and code-first workflow. this means, if you have an idea you want to run by people, you can open a github [issue](https://github.com/webdotcommunity/web.community/issues) to discuss. if you want to start with an idea in code directly, feel free.

code changes happen via [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/webdotcommunity/web.community/pulls), and require at least 1 code review "approval" from another member of the team. we currently don't have any automated checks, but if we get any in the future, those will be required to pass, too. once you have the needed approvals, feel free to merge your change!


# how do i get access?
msg @junosuarez to get added to the `website-editors` team in the webdotcommuntiy github org. this will give you write access to the repo!


# can we add x, y, z?
above all, this will be by-and-for our community and embody the web community ethos. part of that is that anyone in the community can make proposals for improvements.
